# express-hello-world

## Requirements

Make a Node.js program named `express-hello-world.js` that outputs "Hello World"
to browsers making a GET request to the root (/) url.

Also, to browsers that make a GET request to the /time url, send the current
date and time in ISO format: `2015-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`.

Finally, use an environment variable named `PORT` for the port number if one is
provided. If one is not provided use 8080.

i.e. The command below should start a server on the port 1337.

```bash
PORT=1337 node express-hello-world.js
```

and the command below should start a server on the port 8080.

```bash
node express-hello-world.js
```
